# DogCatClassifier 

Our project is a image recognition program using OpenCV in Python with Convolution layers

### How to run
1. Install libraries in requirements.txt
2. Run the following line where ```file``` is the path to the image file to classify

```python3 classifier.py file```

### This program will differentiate between Dogs (a.k.a. doggos)
